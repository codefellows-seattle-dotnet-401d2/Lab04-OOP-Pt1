## Project Name
Author: Jeff Martinez
Version: 1.0.0 

## Overview
This application is built to showcase the principal and importance of inheritance between classes and objects.  In this case, we are "building" a Zoo with different types of animals that can be seen at a zoo.  The Zoo serves as the base class and the breakdown of animals fall from the Mammals class to the different types of Zebras and Lions.  

## Getting Started
1. In order to build this app you must create a base class that will serve as a blueprint for your derived classes
2. You must then create a derived class that can have the option to add more derived classes to inherit propeties from the base and current classes
3. Then add a derived class that may serve as an object to end the path of inheritance

## Example
Base Class to Derived Class setup

Tests to check for working inheritance
```c#

```

## Architecture
This application is created using ASP.NET Core
- Language: C# 
- Type of Applicaiton: Console Application
